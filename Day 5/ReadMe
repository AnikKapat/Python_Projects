### 🔐 Day 5 - Py-Password Generator

A flexible Python-based password generator that creates strong passwords using letters, symbols, and numbers. It offers two styles — a predictable one and a shuffled (more secure) version.

**Features:**
- User specifies number of letters, symbols, and numbers
- Two password styles:
  - ✅ Normie: characters in order (letters → symbols → numbers)
  - 🔀 Gen-Z: characters randomly shuffled for higher security
- Uses `random.choice()` and `random.shuffle()`
